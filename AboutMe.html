       <p class="textwr">Brendan Davis has worn many hats. He produced and co-wrote a 6 episode web series, worked as a bookkeeper, won more than a thousand dollars playing a geeky card game, received a BA in history, wrote about himself in the third person, and very briefly repaired pinball machines. Although originally from Florida he moved to Seattle in 2008 to live in a wonderful city and get as far away from Florida as possible while remaining in the continental US. Now he's studying programming and wakes up every morning excited for another challenging day.</p>
